Comparison PO with Pivot Table

I had to take all the Production of PO's residing in All Department Stock Report of Toe Linking and Press Department.
The problem was the Production of PO's of Toe Linking and Press Department Data was in following form:-

 PO                  Dzn      
9990                28654
9990                36684
9990                25146
9991                5845
9991                3484
9991                2145
9992                350
9992                450 
9992                121
9992                1958
9992                252
9993                1514
9993                4587
9993                2545
9994                1251
9994                1254

I needed the SUM each of each PO. So I solved this problem through the Microsoft Excel built in Pivot Table. Thank you Microsoft.

1. Inserting the Pivot Table from INSERT TAB
2. Put the PO to the ROWS and Dzn (Production) to the VALUES
3. Uncheck the Pivot Fields and copy the Pivot Data
4. Pase the Pivot Data to new Excel Sheet

I've also given the instruction in images as well.
