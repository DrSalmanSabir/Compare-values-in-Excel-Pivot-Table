Comparison PO with Pivot Table

I had to take all the Production of PO's residing in All Department Stock Report of Toe Linking and Press Department.
The problem was the Production of PO's of Toe Linking and Press Department Data was in following form:-

I needed the SUM each of each PO. So I solved this problem through the Microsoft Excel built in Pivot Table. Thank you Microsoft.

1. Inserting the Pivot Table from INSERT TAB
2. Put the PO to the ROWS and Dzn (Production) to the VALUES
3. Uncheck the Pivot Fields and copy the Pivot Data
4. Pase the Pivot Data to new Excel Sheet

I've also given the instruction in images as well.
